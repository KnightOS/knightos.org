_layout/documentation requires typeahead and documentation
the head template includes jquery and bootstrap... but only the "what can I do to help" actually uses it
documentation/reference doesn't actually use JS; all of the files have empty script tags produced by kdoc (the kdoc template has commmented out the script that would be there)
