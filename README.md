## Contributing

If you would like to help make [knightos.org](http://www.knightos.org) better, you can easily edit any page by clicking the "Edit this page" button. If you want to do more in-depth changes to knightos.org, you can host a local copy on your system.

### Hosting a local copy

If you do not have ruby installed on your system, you need to get it from [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). After installing ruby, you will need to install the ruby gem jekyll by running

    gem install jekyll

Be sure to also install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and Coffee-Script

    npm install -g coffee-script

After installing the prerequisites, clone this repository and navigate to its root directory

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/KnightOS/knightos.org.git
    cd knightos.org


Then, you can generate the site and start the local server by using

    jekyll serve

Now, you can visit http://127.0.0.1:4000 in your browser to see your local copy of knightos.org. Any changes that you make to the site source will automatically be updated when you refresh the page.
